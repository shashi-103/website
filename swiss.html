        <p class="details">Switzerland — the heart of the Alps — is a land of breathtaking mountain peaks, crystal-clear lakes, and storybook villages. Famous for its precision, chocolate, and charm, Switzerland blends natural beauty with modern sophistication. Wander through Zurich’s stylish streets, sail on Lake Geneva, or ride the iconic Glacier Express through snow-capped landscapes. Whether you’re skiing in Zermatt, hiking in Interlaken, or savoring fondue in Lucerne, every corner offers a postcard-perfect view. Clean, safe, and beautifully organized — Switzerland is where adventure meets serenity.

        <p class="info">Switzerland’s largest city, Zurich, is where modern elegance dances with old-world charm. Picture cobblestone streets winding through the medieval Altstadt (Old Town), stylish boutiques along Bahnhofstrasse, and crystal-clear waters glistening on Lake Zurich.
By day, hop between art galleries, cafés, and lake cruises; by night, discover a city that hums with fine dining, rooftop bars, and vibrant nightlife. Zurich isn’t just Switzerland’s financial capital — it’s its creative heartbeat, blending culture, cuisine, and a love for the good life.</p>
